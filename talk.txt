1. Who am I 

2. What is resource embedding

3. Talk is meant to overview for deeper inspection. Won't show an "elegant" way to manage this. Won't show how to do it in a super platform independent way. Just the bare-bones needed to do this.

4. Questions:
- Who here knows of or has used the SDL library?
- Who here is familiar with stb libraries, specifically stb_image?
- Who here develops for windows specifically using the VisualC/C++ toolchain?
- Who here develops for linux?
- Who here develops for Mac?
- Who here is familiar with static vs dynamic linking?


5. Typical example of accessing resources. What talk is NOT ABOUT :p

6. Resource embedding the Unix-y way with objcopy (Which you can also do on windows)
	- MINGW64 -> objcopy

7. Resource embedding the Windows specific way
